# Benchmarking LLM Prompting Methods for Financial Tasks
## Or, Zero is Not Hero Yet: Replicated and Expanded

This codebase contains all of the python scripts, dataset, and results for my mini-paper/report on comparing LLM prompting method performance on financial tasks against each other and fine-tuned classical NLP models. This work was conducted as a part of the FinTech lab at Georgia Tech. It was forked off of the original paper, but code was changed and expanded for new research questions.
